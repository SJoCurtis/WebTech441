# Homework One
This week was difficult for me, mostly because my computer is broken so I sent it into Apple, and due to this, am forced to use a friend's computer as my development space currently. Yet, even this, plus the fact that time management is not my forte, I still managed to create an alright website. I didn't review quite as much as I should have, but it is functional, and once my computer is returned this whole process will become quite a bit easier, and the products thereof of higher quality.
In the real of troubleshooting, when the site was finally posted, at first it wouldn't even go live, and even when that problem was fixed, I still had a non-functional background, and some truly awful formatting on my text. However, these problems were solved in due time, and all appears well.
