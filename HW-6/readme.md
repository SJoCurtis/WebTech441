This week wasn't particularly difficult, but a little weird, and at times frustrating. This was new content, but mostly built for simple understanding. So it was not hard. I say it was weird because i'd never built a webpage in a similar manner before, so I felt a little contained. Like an artist in a studio, but only allowed to use a lone crayon. You can make something decent, but not exactly precise.It was frustrating because styling and positioning becomes a little tricky when you cant utilize any of you tools from your tool-bag. For the sake of a simplistic website, this if fine, but for any other type-this is a little lacking. I'm excited for Javascript HTML CSS integration. Web design will become a pretty fun playground.
