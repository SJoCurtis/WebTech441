# HW-4 Readme
## Jo Curtis
This week has definitely been interesting. I wouldn't say difficult, just *a lot* of new content to absorb. It was time consuming and I needed quite a bit more help than I originally thought I would. I think I did alright with the homework but I still don't feel confident that I understand everything to your standards. Some things I definitely get, other things are educated guesses at this point. Going forward from this week I see a long struggle ahead, but so far , its still just the beginning.
> My biggest struggle this week has been absorbing all the thing we learned, and though they all go together nicely, my brain is still a small sponge. Unfortunately.
