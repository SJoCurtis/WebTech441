### Objects Are ~~Meh~~ Awesome :stuck_out_tongue:
No, but really. This was actually an easier week than last. I mean I don't know why but I just get the whole object orientated programming a bit more than the other stuff. I mean I took creative coding and creative coding two, so the basics of this are review. There are some minor differences in execution. Also, the outcomes aren't as cool haha, but it is coming back to me a bit. This week was easy for me to get through content wise, and I felt a little bit more confident than usual. And I am excited for whatever comes next.
