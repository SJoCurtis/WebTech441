# Homework Eight Review

### JSON & API
---
I was the most satisfied with this section.

The past two weeks were really very interesting, I definitely enjoyed JQuery, JSON, and API stuff. I will say it was quite a bit of new knowledge, but it all fit together well, and gives the tools for a far more dynamic page. My homework this week was really from the javascript project section with freecodecamp where your create a generator of some sort that uses JSON, and API retrieval. Thank the lord for freecodecamp, they always help me a lot, and are half the reason I know how to program anything in the first place haha. Anyways, this was a good two weeks, I'm looking forward to working on a final project for the class, it ought to be fun.
