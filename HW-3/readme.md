# HW-3 Readme
## Jo Curtis
I would say that this week was ultimately simple. It was simple as far as what was required, and the reading was nice. Although Javascript rhetoric can be tricky, its not yet too difficult. I wouldn't call it easy by any means, just simple. Right now that is. Javascript always reminds me why math is good haha. I liked this weeks assignment, but I'm nervous for what is to come.
